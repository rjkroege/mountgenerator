This is  a tool to scan the list of named disks mounted on the system and
then generates a `systemd` mount unit for each of the mounted disks.

Build the tool and install somewhere convenient very early in the setup
of a node that uses `systemd`.

Archived now that I no longer setup virtual machine nodes this way.
